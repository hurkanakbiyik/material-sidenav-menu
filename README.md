Angular Material Sidenav Menu

[Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/) is a specification for a
unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices. Our
goal is to deliver a lean, lightweight set of AngularJS-native UI elements that implement the
material design specification for use in Angular single-page applications (SPAs).

Visit [Angular-Material](https://github.com/angular/material) for more
